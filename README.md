## YOUTUBE PROJECT
Andrew Pacumio, Thanh Le, and Teddy Ta

**Purpose:**
The original idea for this analysis was to answer a question that many people may ask: I have no idea but I want to create a Youtube
channel to monetize on the popularity of Youtube and advertising income potential. What video category should I look into that garners the most views and likes?
To answer this question Youtube video popularity data for all regions was analyzed to determine which video category receives the most views

**Analysis:**
* The list of popular videos is continuously changing due to high volume of views from global users
* Although videos in downloaded data changes continously, the overall leader category in popularity is Music
* Music videos not only has the most views overall, but was also the most viewed category regardless of geographic region
